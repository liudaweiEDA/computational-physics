# Massively Parallel Semiconductor Device Simulation using Quantum Monte-Carlo

During my work as a researcher in the Semiconductor Device Modelling Lab (SDML) at Shahed University, I developed a parallel nano-scale device level Monte-Carlo simulator. The program was purely developed in Fortran and MPI. The source code of this simulator can be found in the source directory of this repository.

**Licence:** Note that the code can be changed and reused as long as you keep the copyright inside and at the beginning of source files in the source directory unchanged. If this tool is used in a research project that ends up with a publication, it should be cited as _Alireza Poshtkohi and Kamyar Saghafi, A parallel, MPI-based nano-scale device level Monte-Carlo simulator, <https://github.com/poshtkohi/computational-physcis>_.

The parallel algorithm is shown below
